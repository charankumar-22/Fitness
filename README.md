# This project focuses on calorie estimation and fitness tracking using machine learning techniques. It leverages Random Forest Regression and other ML models to predict calorie expenditure based on user activity data. The system integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to enhance accuracy. A Flask-based web application is developed for user interaction, providing real-time fitness insights. The project aims to improve personalized health monitoring by addressing gaps in existing calorie estimation methods. ðŸš€
